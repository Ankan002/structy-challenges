# Problem 13

- Write a function, addLists, that takes in the head of two linked lists, each representing a number. The nodes of the linked lists contain digits as values. The nodes in the input lists are reversed; this means that the least significant digit of the number is the head. The function should return the head of a new linked listed representing the sum of the input lists. The output list should have its digits reversed as well.
