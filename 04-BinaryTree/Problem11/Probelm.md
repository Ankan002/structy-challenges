# Problem 11

- Write a function, allTreePaths, that takes in the root of a binary tree. The function should return a 2-Dimensional array where each subarray represents a root-to-leaf path in the tree.

- The order within an individual path must start at the root and end at the leaf, but the relative order among paths in the outer array does not matter.

- You may assume that the input tree is non-empty.
